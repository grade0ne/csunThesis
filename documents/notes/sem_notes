#-- Structural Equation Modeling --#

Endogeneous variables .: dependent variables; are predicted
Exogeneous variables  .: indepedent variables; are predictors only

# Categorical variables (text ref. Grace) -

Not a problem if exogeneous, requires attention if endogenous variables are categorical (still do-able, but you have to do something else first idk)

- lavaan stands for (la)tent (va)riable (an)alysis

- indirect effects: label the slopes of the exogeneous variables of interest, then in a separate line, use those slope labels (aka. explicitly labeled regression parameters) to compute indirect effects like this ---
		intention ~ 1 + a*legacy
		donation ~ 1 + b*intention
		ab := a*b 		# <- indirect effect of legacy on donation

- in this example, intention is caused by legacy, and donation is caused by intention.

- the 1 in model syntax just explicitly tells lavaan to include the intercept as predicted by the mean of the endogeneous variable(s)

- model fitting: use anova() to run LRT and compare AIC / p
